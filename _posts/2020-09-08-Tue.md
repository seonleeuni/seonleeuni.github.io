## System service engineering and management
#### Queuing theory
- The mathematical study of the formation, function, and congestion of waiting lines, or queues
- Queuing situation into 2 levels
  - Someone or something that **requests** a service—usually referred to as the **customer, job, or request**
  - Someone or something that **completes** or delivers the services—usually referred to as the **server**
  
- Importance of queuing theory  
Queuing theory is important because it helps describe features of the queue, like average wait time, and provides the tools for optimizing queues. From a business sense, queuing theory informs the construction of efficient and cost-effective workflow systems.

#### System service design 시 유의사항
- Service 목적, 연구 방향을 잘 설정하고, 그에 맞는 데이터를 찾고 알고리즘을 개발해야 한다.
